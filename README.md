yolo-bear
=========

It's backup. With swag.

yolo-bear is a completely self contained backup script that uses only a small
handful of binaries which are called by variable names (yes, on some systems you
might be forced to change them, but that's
1. rare
and
1. better than accidentally calling the wrong binary because some nincompoop has
spoiled things in your $PATH variable.


The name came from github's autosuggestertron.
